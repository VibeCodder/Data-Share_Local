## Password Setup

The server requires HTTP Basic Auth. The password is resolved in the following order (first match wins):

1. **Environment variable**
   ```bash
   FILE_SERVER_PASSWORD=my-secret-password python3 file_server.py
   ```

2. **Command-line argument**
   ```bash
   python3 file_server.py 8000 my-secret-password
   ```

3. **Password file**
   Create a file named `.file_server_password` in the same directory as the script, containing nothing but the password:
   ```bash
   echo "my-secret-password" > .file_server_password
   chmod 600 .file_server_password
   ```

4. **Auto-generated (default)**
   If none of the above is set, the server generates a random password at startup and prints it to the console.

> **Note:** The username is fixed as `admin`. If you use the password file, make sure to add it to `.gitignore` and restrict its file permissions, since it's stored in plain text.

You can also run the app without https using this command:
<br><br>

```
$env:FILE_SERVER_NO_HTTPS="1"; python file_server.py
```
You must also install:

```
pip install tkinterdnd2
```
